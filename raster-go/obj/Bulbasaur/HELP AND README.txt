============== NOTICE ABOUT POSSIBLE NON-FUNCTIONAL MODELS ==============

This folder contains many files which can be used to open the 3D model you requested. The folder will most likely contain the model as-extracted from many different games, so if you open the .blend file and it is non-functional, try the other .objs or MD5 meshes too! You should try them in this order:

============== HELP AND OTHER FILES ==============

>> To open .x files in MMD, just click and drag them from the folder, onto the MMD workspace. It does work. Trust me.
>> .WAV files are audio files. Please don't try and use them in 3D modelling.
>> For examples of how theise models can be used, checkout http://themoderator.deviantart.com
>> See our youtube at RootOfEvilStudios (http://www.youtube.com/user/RootOfEvilStudios) for tutorials and latest announcements.
>> No I will not make a C4D tutorial.
>> Yes I will attend your wedding/barmitsvua. If you pay me.

For more info on how to use theise files, please look at the tutorials I do to show you how BEFORE PM/EMAILing me. If you don't read/watch them and ask me a question I have already answered, I will publish your physical address to youtube and allow people to troll you from thereon.
